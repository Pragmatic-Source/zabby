= TODO list for Zabby

Zabby is still a young projet! There are many features missing and possible improvements:

- Document the code with *Yard*
- Write tests:
  - Use RSpec
  - Use a _webmock_ to simulate a Zabix Server, maybe *VCR*
- Validate API verbs and parameters
- Betting Exceptions and error handling
- Improve online help in the shell:
  - Order help entries
  - Document Zabbix classes
- Improve or merge +zabbysh+ and +zabbyrb+
- Document command line parsing
